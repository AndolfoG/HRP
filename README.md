# Introduction
Welcome to the full-length **H**omology-based **R**-gene **P**rediction (**HRP**) project.
This project aims to develop an informatics pipeline for genome-wide resistance (R)-genes (also known as NB-LRR genes) prediction and classification.
We sincerely wish our method can significantly benefit your R-gene study, and enjoy high-performances.
